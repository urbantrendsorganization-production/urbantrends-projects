# OnboardKit — Deployment (CLAUDE.md §14)

Prod runs on the Hetzner box at `/opt/onboardkit/` (alongside the other stacks
in `/opt`: sitechat, rentflow, urbantrends). Two services
(`api`, `worker`) run from a single GHCR image; Postgres is a compose service;
object storage is Hetzner Object Storage (S3-compatible). No MinIO in prod.

TLS/routing is handled by the **shared host-level Caddy** that already fronts the
other UrbanTrends stacks (sitechat, rentflow, urbantrends) — this stack does not
run its own Caddy. The api publishes on `127.0.0.1:8086` (loopback only, like
every other app on the box); Caddy proxies `onboardkit.urbantrends.dev` →
`127.0.0.1:8086`.

The host Caddy loads per-service blocks via `import /etc/caddy/conf.d/*.caddy`,
so OnboardKit's vhost is a drop-in there (contents in `ops/Caddyfile`). Add it
once — needs a DNS `A` record for `onboardkit.urbantrends.dev` → this box:

```bash
sudo cp ops/Caddyfile /etc/caddy/conf.d/onboardkit.caddy
sudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

## First deploy

OnboardKit lives inside the `urbantrends-projects` monorepo checkout at
`/opt/urbantrends-projects/onboarding-kit`. A `/opt/onboardkit` symlink keeps the
paths in this doc, the Caddy `root`, and `backup.sh` short:

```bash
ssh hetzner
sudo ln -s /opt/urbantrends-projects/onboarding-kit /opt/onboardkit
cd /opt/onboardkit
cp ops/.env.example ops/.env  # then fill in real secrets (never commit ops/.env)
cd ops

# In ops/.env, set the image coordinates (the compose defaults are placeholders):
#   GHCR_REPO=urbantrendsorganization-production/urbantrends-projects
#   IMAGE_TAG=main
# plus real JWT_SECRET, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, and S3_* (Hetzner Object Storage).

# Log in to GHCR to pull the private image (PAT with read:packages).
echo "$GHCR_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u <user> --password-stdin

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env up -d
```

Migrations run automatically at api/worker startup (`sqlx::migrate!` embedded),
so a fresh database self-provisions on boot.

Seed the demo tenant (optional, demo box only). The `seed` binary ships in the
image (built alongside `api`/`worker`); it is idempotent and never runs on boot:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env run --rm api seed
```

## Updates (CD)

CI builds and pushes `ghcr.io/<repo>/backend:latest` (and a `sha-…` tag) on
every push to `main`. To roll forward:

```bash
cd /opt/onboardkit/ops
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env up -d
```

Pin `IMAGE_TAG=sha-<commit>` in `.env` to deploy a specific build; to roll back,
set it to a previous sha and `up -d` again.

## Backups

`ops/backup.sh` dumps Postgres into `/opt/backups` (gzip) and prunes
past the retention window. Install as a daily cron:

```cron
0 3 * * *  /opt/onboardkit/ops/backup.sh >> /var/log/onboardkit-backup.log 2>&1
```

## Mobile app (agent APK / Play Store)

The Flutter agent app is **not** part of the server stack — it's built and
distributed separately. The API base URL is compiled in at build time, so the
build must target the deployed backend, not localhost.

Build the release AAB for Google Play:

```bash
cd apps/agent
flutter build appbundle --release \
  --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://onboardkit.urbantrends.dev \
  --dart-define=CONSENT_TERMS_VERSION=v1     # must match the server's CONSENT_TERMS_VERSION
```

For a sideloadable demo APK, swap `appbundle` for `apk`.

### Publish the APK for download over the website

The host Caddy serves a public download page + APK from `/opt/onboardkit/public/`
(see the `/download` block in `ops/Caddyfile`). To publish a build:

```bash
# On the build machine — produce the signed APK (see signing setup below).
cd apps/agent
flutter build apk --release \
  --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://onboardkit.urbantrends.dev \
  --dart-define=CONSENT_TERMS_VERSION=v1

# Copy the page (once) and the APK (each release) to the server.
scp ops/public/index.html  hetzner:/opt/onboardkit/public/index.html
scp apps/agent/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk \
    hetzner:/opt/onboardkit/public/onboardkit-agent.apk
```

The APK is a release artifact and is gitignored (`ops/public/.gitignore`); only
`index.html` is tracked. Once the files are in place:

- Download page: `https://onboardkit.urbantrends.dev/download`
- Direct link:   `https://onboardkit.urbantrends.dev/download/onboardkit-agent.apk`

No Caddy reload is needed to swap the APK — `file_server` picks up the new file
immediately. (Reload Caddy only when you first add the `/download` block.)

`CONSENT_TERMS_VERSION` must equal the server value (`ops/.env`) or the consent
endpoint rejects submissions. Bump `version:` in `apps/agent/pubspec.yaml`
(`x.y.z+build`) for every Play upload — the `+build` number must increase.

### Release signing (one-time setup)

Play uploads must be signed with a real upload key, not the debug key. Signing
is driven by `apps/agent/android/key.properties` (gitignored):

1. Generate an upload keystore, stored **outside** the repo:
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/keys/onboardkit/upload-keystore.jks \
     -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
   ```
2. `cp android/key.properties.example android/key.properties` and fill in the
   passwords, alias, and absolute `storeFile` path.
3. Enable **Play App Signing** in the Play Console (Google holds the real app
   signing key; `key.properties` is only your upload key — recoverable if lost).

When `key.properties` is absent, the release build falls back to debug signing
(so `flutter run --release` works for devs) — that build is **not** publishable.

App id: `dev.urbantrends.agent`. Never commit `key.properties`, `*.jks`, or
`*.keystore` — all gitignored.

## Alerting (baseline)

The api/worker log JSON in prod (`APP_ENV=production`). Minimum viable alerting
until a full stack is wired:

- **Uptime:** external check on `https://onboardkit.urbantrends.dev/api/v1/health`
  (e.g. UptimeRobot / healthchecks.io) — page on non-200.
- **Error logs:** ship container logs (`docker compose logs`) to the box's
  journal; alert on `level":"ERROR"` frequency. Worker job failures surface as
  `job failed` warnings and, after `max_attempts`, a `failed` row in `jobs`.
- **Stuck jobs:** cron query
  `SELECT count(*) FROM jobs WHERE status='failed'` — alert if non-zero.
- **Backups:** healthchecks.io ping appended to the cron line above; alert if the
  daily ping is missed.

These are deliberately lightweight (§ "no gold-plating"); a fuller
Prometheus/Grafana stack is a post-pilot item.
